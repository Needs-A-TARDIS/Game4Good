It’s the afternoon of the O-Week's second day, and your parents just left campus to drive back home, 500 miles away. Your roommate is still hanging out with her brother, a junior, and his friends. You sit at your desk, aware that you don’t know anyone at Duke. You remember that your RA planned an ice cream social for the hall, but also realize that you’re already falling behind on your goal of going to the gym each day. What do you do?

What do you do?
